# FileCreationGUI
A GUI that takes in EE Data as input and then creates a file for that employee with the requested files in said folder.

Current Code:
- Added .bat file for execution due to software download constrictions
- Semi-Improved GUI
- Asks for Fname, Lname, Building Number, Type (N or R), in Case of N a Subtype of (New App, Renewal, Active ID/Second ID)
- Logic works properly. Tested all variable options.
